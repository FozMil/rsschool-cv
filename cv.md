## About Me
During my educational practice at the EPAM Training Center, I successfully completed courses in .Net and version control with Git, where I mastered the basics of .Net development and effective use of Git version control system.

As part of my studies, I developed a web application for a book online store "Bookstore" using C#, HTML, and CSS. This project showcases my skills in web development and programming languages. [Link to the project: <https://github.com/FozMil/Bookstore>]

I also have experience participating in the Tecnovation Girls international competition, where under the mentorship of Unicef, my team and I developed a prototype application to help children learn about their rights through gamification and to provide access to lawyers for consultations. My role in the project included developing the business logic and business plan. As a result, Unicef released the application based on our prototype.

In addition, I actively participated in organizing student events on campus and worked in teams, which enhanced my teamwork, event organization skills, and effective collaboration within a team.

I am eager to further develop my programming skills and apply them in practice to contribute to company goals and achieve personal professional growth.
